# ProtGPT2 Reward Modeling Results

This repository contains results from a ProtGPT2 model trained with a reward modeling objective. The results are provided in a CSV file with the following columns:

- **x1**: The first protein sequence.
- **x2**: The second protein sequence.
- **prediction**: The model's prediction based on the input sequences.
- **reward\_score**: The reward score generated by the reward model. This is reported as the primary evaluation metric instead of binding probabilities because the modelâ€™s output is not a probability distribution.

The reward score column provides an evaluation metric for the predictions made by the model.
